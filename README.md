Tic Tac Toe in C++
Description:
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It supports single-player mode where the player competes against the computer, showcasing fundamental programming concepts and interactive gameplay.

Features:

Interactive Gameplay: Player versus computer mode with automated moves by the computer.
Dynamic Game Board: A clean console representation of the 3x3 grid, updated after each move.
Game Logic: Comprehensive checks for win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and ties.
Randomized Computer Moves: The computer makes its moves based on randomization, ensuring unpredictable gameplay.
Input Validation: Ensures players cannot overwrite previously marked spots.
Technical Highlights:

Uses a one-dimensional character array to represent the game board.
Modular design with separate functions for key tasks like drawing the board, handling player/computer moves, checking for winners, and detecting ties.
Utilizes rand() from <ctime> to simulate computer moves.
Demonstrates fundamental C++ concepts such as loops, conditional statements, pointers, and arrays.
How to Play:

The player chooses a spot (1-9) to place their marker ('X').
The computer places its marker ('O') in an available spot.
The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a tie.
Results (win/lose/tie) are displayed after each game.
